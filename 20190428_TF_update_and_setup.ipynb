        "This notebook was assembled by [Nels Lindahl](http://nelslindahl.com/) as part of the ⚡#PoweredByTF 2.0 Challenge! from Devpost. This effort was built out to do some analysis on voter data records using TensorFlow. I hope some of it is useful to you. This notebook will help you check the installed version TensorFlow you are running or alternatively install TensorFlow via pip. For the purposes of the challenge we are making sure the version being installed is 2.0.0-alpha0. Future you reading this might note a much newer version. That is of course awesome. "
